1. Resons to Store as HASH
    -> Record has many attributes
    -> The records has to be sorted many different ways
    -> Often need to access a single record at a time

2. When DO NOT HASH
    -> The record is only for counting or enforcing uniqueness
    -> Records only one or two attributes
    -> Used only for creating relations between different records
    -> The record is only used for time series data
